            <h4>Dragons</h4>
            <p>It can’t breath fire or fly, but the megalania(aka Devil Dragon) was the largest terrestrial lizard that
                ever existed,
                and is believed to be the ancestor of the modern komodo dragon. The creature could extrete a venomous
                toxin from its
                oral glands, and was known to eat large sized mammals and giant marsupials. The megalania could exceed
                lengths of 26
                feet and likely competed with early indigenous settlers of Australia, perhaps contributing to their
                eventual extinction.</p>

            <h4>Imugi</h4>
            <p>The Imugi, also known as the korean dragon, was for years thought to be the stuff of legends. It was
                thought that such a
                creature could never exist, that is untilthe python was actually discovered in South America. Now
                extinct, the Giant
                titanoboa could grow up to 46 feet long and weighed over a ton. In 2012 a life size model of the
                creature was displayed
                in Grand Central station in New York.</p>

            <h4>Amazonian Warriors</h4>
            <p>Greek legends and popular superhero Wonder Woman have popularized the notion of the Amazonian in pop
                culture. Legendary
                warriors exclusively made up of women. As it turns out such a tribe did exist in Asia minor. Skeletal
                remains of battle
                hardened damaged female warriors were discovered in Eurasia, buried with bows, arrows, and other
                weaponry. Whether
                you’re a fan of Xena Warrior Princess or an admirer of history this is an extremely interesting find.
                You can read more
                about the warriors in this National Geographic article.</p>

            <h4>Berserkers</h4>
            <p>Northern European legends tell the tale of legendary warriors who fought in uncontrollable trance-like
                fury. Their
                legendary conquests lend credence to the english phrase “Going Berserk.” As it turns out such warriors
                did in fact exist
                and fought in battle among vikings. These Juggernauts dominated the battlefield by either working
                themselves into a
                frenzy or taking intoxicating drugs before embarking on the battlefield.</p>

            <h4>Hobbits</h4>
            <p>In 2004 the skeletal remains of Homo floresiensis were discovered in the Indonesian island of Flores
                dating back about
                18,000 years ago. Each of the nine skeletons was only about 3 feet tall and had skulls about one third
                the size of
                normal humans. Sounds like something straight out of a Tolkien novel.</p>

            <h4>Dracula</h4>
            <p>It may come as a shock to many, but the infamous vampire was based on an actual person who lived less
                than 500 years
                ago. Vlad the impaler or Vlad Dracula was a bloodthirsty romania prince who would torture and kill his
                enemies by
                impaling them. He was also known to consume the blood of his victims. Anecdotes of his cruel campaigns
                and deathly
                demeanor spread throughout Germany and Italy later inspiring the famous 1897 novel Dracula. Vlad was
                eventually killed
                in a military campaign against the Ottoman Empire in January 1477.</p>

            <h4>Giant Sloths</h4>
            <p>The most recent discovery on this list was the fact that giant sloths with wolverine claws used to roam
                America and
                fought with ancient humans! Fossil evidence uncovered in the sands of New Mexico revealed the
                particularly curious tale
                of such creatures. The giant sloth footprints were discovered alongside human footprints suggesting that
                early humans
                were closely stalking the beast in search of food. You can read more about the discovery in this
                Smithsonian article.</p>
