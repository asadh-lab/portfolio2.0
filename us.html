        <p>In this final section I thought it would be interesting to take a look at some local US folklore and urban
            legends.
            Perhaps the most famous being that of Bigfoot or the sasquatch. Appearing in both Canadian and American
            folklore, the
            sasquatch is an ape like creature said to inhabit forest environments. The most famous documented evidence
            for the
            creature is the Patterson-Gimlin film, a short video taken in 1967 in Northern California by filmmaker Roger
            Patterson.
            While many skeptics are quick to claim its a man in a suit, others have keenly noted that based on the
            physiological
            makeup of the creature it appeared to be a female and pregnant. That is an impressive amount of nuance if
            the creature
            is indeed a man in a suit. Most scientists discounted the existence of bigfoot and consider all the evidence
            to be
            misidentification, hoax, and folklore. Nevertheless, based on the sheer size of the territory it inhabits as
            well as the
            creatures alleged practice of burying its dead, we may never definitively be able to disprove such a
            creatureâ€™s
            existence.
            The Mothman is a creature in West Virginia folklore that has a grotesque figure and glowing red eyes. The
            creature was
            first sighted by two young couples on November 15, 1966. The pair of couples were driving past an abandoned
            World War II
            munitions plant when they sighted the creature. It immediately gave chase and stalked their car from the sky
            at an
            amazing speed. When questioned separately by the local sheriff amazingly all of them gave similar accounts
            and
            depictions of the creature. Since then several other sightings of the creature have appeared around the area
            and the
            Mothman is now a staple of the town. The Mothman has become a major tourist attraction and several museums
            and tourist
            themed stores celebrate the legend. You can actually watch the episode of Buzzfeed unsolved below where
            Shane and Ryan
            visit the town and locals and uncover the mystery of the Mothman.
            Navajo legends tell the story of the skin-walker. A harmful witch that has the ability to possess, or
            disguise
            themselves as animals. Animals associated with such creatures include coyotes and wolves. There is a tract
            of land today
            known as skinwalker ranch in which the owners reportedly sight the creatures a couple times each year. Today
            Skinwalkers
            remain an integral part of American mythology.
