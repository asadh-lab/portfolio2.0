        <h2>Legendary Creatures That May Exist!</h2>
        <p>From time to time, around the world reports of sightings of creatures that are less than human. Creatures of
            legend that
            have only been written about in folklore and fiction, only theorized to exist. However some of these
            mysterious
            creatures may not be legends afterall…. For those of you who are rolling your eyes I implore you to keep an
            open
            mind.
            Afterall it wasn’t long ago that Gorillas were thought to be creatures of legend. During the 1600s an
            English
            sailor
            Andrew Battle on an expedition in West Africa described two man-like apes that would visit his campsite at
            the
            dead of
            night. It wasn’t until the late 1800s that Gorillas were formally discovered by the scientific community.
            With
            that
            being said are any of these creatures waiting to be discovered?</p>

            <h2>Merfolk</h2>
            <p>For as long as man has been able to sail, reports of aquatic life resembling humans have proliferated.
                What’s especially
                interesting is reports of such creatures appearing in multiple cultures worldwide, including Europe,
                Asia, Africa, and
                the far East. These legends range from beautiful maidens to dark omens who drag sailors to their death.
                While tales of
                such creatures are probably highly romanticized in legend, scientifically speaking such aquatic forms of
                human life
                aren’t impossible. Perhaps a missing link in the evolutionary chain?.</p>

            <h2>Mongolian Death Worm</h2>
            <p>There’s good reason to believe the mongolian death worm of legend might actually be real. The creature is
                said to
                inhabit the sands of the Gobi desert in northwest Mongolia and China. Legends in the region tell the
                tale of a massive
                acid spitting worm-like creature that can reach a staggering 1.5 meters or 5 feet in length. The first
                scientific
                documentation of the legend appeared in 1926 by anthropologist Roy Andrews. Since then several
                expeditions have been
                dispatched to the desert in search of the legendary creature. While no conclusive evidence has been
                found the Gobi
                desert is so vast it's not unfathomable that such a creature may be lurking under its hot sands.</p>

            <h2>Kongamato</h2>
            <p>The Kangamato is a flying beaked reptilian creature that first appeared in East Central African legend.
                Resembling the
                pterodactyl,the name literally translates to overwhelmed boats, as such pterodactyl-like creatures are
                known to actively
                prey on people crossing rivers and swamps. As recently as 1958 the scientific journalist Maurice Burton
                wrote about
                pterodactyl sightings in the Congo prompting speculation that perhaps such creatures may actually be
                prehistoric
                animals.</p>

        <div class="Mapinguari text">
            <h2>Mapinguari</h2>
            <p>Several Amazonian tribal legends tell the story of the Mapinguari, a sloth-like creature. Interestingly
                enough the
                Mapinguari’s description is so consistent and well described by several native tribes in the amazon that
                have no contact
                with another. This has prompted some scientists to organize expeditions to find the creature to no luck.
                Unlike Bigfoot
                who is said to flee human contact, the Mapinguari is a creature of terror that is known to prey on
                unfortunate souls
                lost in the Amazon’s dense foliage. Sightings of the Mapinguari persist to this day including farmers
                who claim the
                creature will eat their cattle in the dead of night.</p>

        <div class="Nessie text">
            <h2>Loch Ness Monster</h2>
            <p>The infamous loch ness monster, or Nessie as locals affectionately call him, has been sighted since as
                early as 565 AD!
                The loch ness monster most closely resembles the plesiosaur which has been said to be extinct for a
                millennium….or at
                least officially. The plesiosaur was said to be able to reach 15 meters (49 feet) in length which is
                scary accurate to
                eye witness accounts of Nessie. While sightings of the creature are few and far between there was a
                recent spike in
                sightings in 2017, leading many to wonder what lies beneath the surface.</p>

        <div class="Kraken text">
            <h2>Kraken</h2>
            <p>Of all the creatures that may exist on this list, the Kraken is perhaps the most probable. You may have
                notied alot of the creatures on this lost are aquatic. That's because as surprising
                as it may sound
                it is easier for us to land a person on the moon then the ocean floor, and in today’s world 80% of the
                world’s oceans
                remain unexplored. So who knows what may lurk in the depths of the ocean. Sailor tales depicting a
                squid-like creature
                attacking vessels is the stuff of nightmares. Giant squids have been known to reach lengths of up to 59
                feet. So the
                kraken isn’t as far of a stretch as one might imagine.</p>

        <div class="Yeti text">
            <h2>Yeti</h2>
            <p>While much of the scientific community regard tales of the Yeti as nothing more than himalayan folklore,
                much of the
                himalayan wilderness remains unexplored. Several footprints of mysterious bipedal creatures have been
                discovered and
                well documented. So is the Yeti a creature of legend or a mysterious creature roaming the mountains
                waiting to be
                discovered?</p>
